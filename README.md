# descartes-test
Technical test for the recruitment process.

In here you will find 2 datasets, train_auto.csv and test_auto.csv. The idea is to predict the target TARGET_FLAG with a ML algorithm. The code should return a performance evaluation of the tested algorithms and a csv file with the prediction, which I have called test_auto_out.csv. 
The whole process can be performed with the jupyter notebook called Descartes.ipynb.
